# Lecture material for course "Quadratic forms and class fields II"
Course taught at Charles University in Spring 2024.

Here I will post lecture notes which accompany the lectures.
They contain a summary of the material covered during the lectures, as well as additional exercises which can be done to help with the study of the material.
Any feedback is appreciated and can either be communicated here on Github, or via e-mail to [nicolas.daans@matfyz.cuni.cz](mailto:nicolas.daans@matfyz.cuni.cz).
